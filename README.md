#Welcome!
 
Hey there! This is my first project that provides some use!

##Each file provides a different use:

###pixelDensity.py

This program takes the **diagonal length** of the screen and calculates its pixel density.

###densityWidthHeight.py (I should've named this something else)

This program takes the width **or** height of a screen you'd like and calculates pixel density and the diagonal length.

###FOV/fovCalculator.py

This program takes the diagonal screen length of a screen, as well as the viewing distance. It then calculates whether the screen falls within the outer limits of a human's
Image Recognition FOV.

###feature_testing_and_dump

This wasn't supposed to be uploaded <sub>but I don't want to delete it!</sub>
