# Welcome!
 
Hey there! This is my first project that provides some use!

## Each file functions differently:

### pixelDensity.py

This program takes the **_diagonal length_** of the screen and calculates its pixel density.

### pythagoreanPixelDensity.py 

This program takes the width **_or_** height of a screen you'd like and calculates pixel density and the diagonal length.

### fovCalculator.py

This program takes the diagonal screen length of a screen, as well as the viewing distance. It then calculates whether the screen falls within the outer limits of a human's Image Recognition FOV.
